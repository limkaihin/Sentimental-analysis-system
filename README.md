# A Lexicon-Driven Approach to Sentiment Analysis (Sentimental Analysis System)

This project focuses on creating a system to analyse the sentiment of movie reviews using a predefined dictionary. The system will compute sentiment scores for each sentence, identify the positive & negative sentences, and use a sliding window technique to find the positive & negative paragraph segments. Text preprocessing, sentiment scoring, and visualisation will be performed in the project, which will allow us to practice Python programming fundamentals such as string manipulation, modular design, and data visualisation.

### What You Need to Do:

1. **Replace the GitHub URL**: In the **Clone the repository** section, change `https://github.com/yourusername/sentiment-analysis-imdb.git` to your actual repository URL.
2. **License**: Add the `LICENSE` file to your project directory (if not already done), or change the license information if you choose a different license.

This should help others understand your project and how to run it. Let me know if you need further adjustments!
